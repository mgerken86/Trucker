# Trucker-The-Anti-Frogger

Premise:
You're driving to an interview for the job of your dreams. As you're envisioning how great you're going to be as the next Software Engineer at your favorite company, tragedy strikes! Your truck runs over a frog crossing the road.

The frogs have gone mad over this. They seek revenge!

Drive your truck through different levels, avoiding the larger frogs and smashing through the smaller ones. 

Make it to the job interview in one piece to land your dream job!!!



As a user I want to

.Experience different levels featuring completely different gameplay

.Level 1: Dodge large frogs while accumulating points by hitting smaller ones. The large frogs speed up as your points go up

.Level 2: Navigate through a twisty-turny tunnel, avoiding bumping into the sides

.Level 3: Cross the flooded highway by using frog-carcasses as platforms
